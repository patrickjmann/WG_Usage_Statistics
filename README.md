# WG_Usage_Statistics
WestGrid Usage statistics

* Various python scripts to pull CCDB statistics. Note that the api key needs to be set somewhere.

Note that access keys for the api need to be set before running the script. The script reads:
* USAGE_API_KEY
* USAGE_API_HOST
There are no defaults for these.
